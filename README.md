# E-VOTING
This is my personal project about voting application built with React Native and Firebase service allows users to cast their votes for the available options provided by the admin. The app has two roles: admin and user. The admin is responsible for managing the app and adding the voting options for the users. On the other hand, users can cast their votes for the options provided by the admin.

The app allowing users to easily cast their votes for their desired options. It also comes equipped with useful features such as personal preference and voting statistics that can be accessed by the admin and users. Overall, this React Native voting app is a valuable tool for users who want to cast their votes for the available options. Disclaimer this application is still under development and testing so there are still some minor bugs that still I need to fix and all the here footage was taken during the debugging process on react native.

# App demo in Android as Admin

As can be seen from the demo above, it is a process when the admin adds candidates so that users can choose them


# App Demo in Android as Users

Because the admin has added candidates, the user can choose the candidate, each user only has 1 chance to choose a candidate, the user can vote again when the admin has reset all candidates along with the voting system

That's all from the demonstration regarding my project, I hope this can be an inspiration for developers who are just getting into react native mobile application development thank you :)
